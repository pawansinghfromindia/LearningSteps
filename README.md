  <summary>AI and Learning</summary>

<br/>

How we use AI so that it will assist us in order to Learning anything.

As a future developer that is working with AI. <br/>
one of the best way in order to trully build skills and to grow as developer is **by working on complex task and issue on your own**.

So, when you're stuck on complex task and you're pushing yourself to find a solution for it. 
You're writing your code yourself. Here, the magic happens!!

If you jump too quicky and ask the AI for a solution, what you're doing is you're **skipping an
essential step in order to become an expert**. <br/> 
Here, you won't develop skills in order to understand when and where the AI was wrong.

Always try to solve the task on your own. And only turn to AI or Google if you don't have any
more idea on how to solve the task.

> **Find Solution on your own**, ***use AI only if stuck!***
